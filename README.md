We have provided two search bars:one for college and one for city(no field is compulsory to be filled).
This search will produce fake as well as authorised colleges list(if any found).
If one has not found the college entered,one may report on the website.
For that first,he has to register in the website.Then email verification takes place and then he gets logged in.After that one can file a report regarding any college/courses. Once registered in website,user can login through registered mail-id.(ail will be received in spam folder).
